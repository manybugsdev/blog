# How to make APNG animations with SVG and JavaScript

## Motivation

Hello. I am a creator of LINE stickers. Do you know LINE?

https://line.me/en/

LINE is a little minor messaging app in the world. However, almost all people use LINE in my home country, Japan. I think that using LINE is a really fun because many stickers are so cute and unique in LINE.

The stickers are created not only by companies but also by civilians. They could get money when other users buy their stickers.Actually, I have created and sold a bellow sticker about 7 years ago.

I could play the bass a little. I created a sticker for the bassist keeping the rhythm with his chin. There are many bassists shaking their chins while playing the bass.

LINE provide creation guidelines to us so we can create stickers of varius types. I would have liked to create a new type stickers about bassists. I decided to create an [animated sticker](https://creator.line.me/en/guideline/animationsticker/). The animated stickers need APNG files. [Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APNG) is a file format which extends the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) specification to permit animated images that work similarly to animated GIF files.

I have made SVG animation website previously so I found the way to create APNG converted SVG.
