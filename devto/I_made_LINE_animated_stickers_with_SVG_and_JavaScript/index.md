Do you know LINE?

Some people may never have heard of LINE. LINE is a messaging app created by NAVER and now operated by LY Corp. It seems to be less known than Telegram or WhatsApp. In the first place, you might not need to use messaging apps if you have used SNS as a messaging app.

Actually, I have created and sold a bellow sticker about 7 years ago.

Are there many bassists shaking their chins?

私は iPad のような高級品を持っていなかったので、[FireAlpaca](https://firealpaca.com/en)というドローソフトと 1 個のマウスで 40 枚の絵を描きました。拙い絵ですが、かなり大変だったことを覚えています。

このスタンプはこのクオリティですが、毎月 0.2 ドル程度の収益が上がっています。極めて少額ではありますが、維持管理等を一切せずに自動的に収益を上げ続けてくれます。これはすごいことです。

私がこれを売り出した時期ぐらいに、動くスタンプを作ることができるようになりました。せっかくアゴでリズムをとるベーシストなのだから、実際にアゴが動く姿も見てみたいと考えるようになりました。
