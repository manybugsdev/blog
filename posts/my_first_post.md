Hello. I'm a web developer, _Manybugs_. I like Sushi🍣 and Tempura🍤.

I'm a big fan of [Deno🦕](https://deno.com/). I have won a prize in [the Deno KV Hackathon](https://deno.com/blog/deno-kv-hackathon). I would like to thank the Deno team for their generous scoring.

[The source of my super web application](https://github.com/manybugsdev/count-confetti)

I have started solving daily challenges in [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) recently. I hardly understand algorithms even after reading their solutions. I will write blogs as mainly notebook of learning in LeetCode.

Thank you.
