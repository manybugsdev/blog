I think this is an easy problem, not medium. Althogh, it was take some time for me to understand it describe.

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-happiness-of-selected-children/

```js
var maximumHappinessSum = function (happiness, k) {
  let sorted = happiness.toSorted((a, b) => a - b);
  let d = 0;
  let s = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    let v = sorted.pop();
    if (v - i <= 0) break;
    s += v - i;
  }
  return s;
};
```
