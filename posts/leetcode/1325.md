https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-leaves-with-a-given-value/

I decided to stop solving daily problems everyday. I'm so tired. I'm going to join contests sometimes.

Today's problem is a easy tree problem.

```js
let isLeaf = (node) => !node.left && !node.right;
let remove = (node, target) => {
  if (!node) return true;
  if (remove(node.left, target)) {
    node.left = null;
  }
  if (remove(node.right, target)) {
    node.right = null;
  }
  return isLeaf(node) && node.val === target;
};
var removeLeafNodes = function (root, target) {
  return remove(root, target) ? null : root;
};
```
