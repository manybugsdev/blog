I couldn't come up with this solution. The official solution is great. It is amazing to set the all bits on the left column at first.

```js
var matrixScore = function (grid) {
  let m = grid.length;
  let n = grid[0].length;

  for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    if (grid[i][0] === 0) {
      for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        grid[i][j] = 1 - grid[i][j];
      }
    }
  }

  for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
    let countZero = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      if (grid[i][j] === 0) {
        countZero += 1;
      }
    }
    if (countZero > m - countZero) {
      for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        grid[i][j] ^= 1;
      }
    }
  }

  let score = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      let columnScore = grid[i][j] << (n - j - 1);
      score += columnScore;
    }
  }

  return score;
};
```
