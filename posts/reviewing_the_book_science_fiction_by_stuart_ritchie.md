I have read the book Science Fiction by Stuart Ritchie (Japanese translation). I found it interesting and moving. I would like everyone interested in science to read this book.

In 2005, a paper with the shocking title "Most Published Research Findings Are False" was published by [John P.A. Ioannidis](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/john-ioannidis). The mathematical model in this paper shows that every result of scientific papers tends to be
false positive. This is because negative result which differents from research hypothesis is difficult to be reported by writting a thesis.

This John's paper was in the spotlight and it had been cited more than 800 times for 5 years. Unfortunately, this event didn't trigger for mosts scientists to change their mind. However, as the number of research misconducts increases, we are beginning to accept this research result as a reality.

Stuart explains the mechanism of occuring a research misconduct in the book with quoting famous incidents and documents. There are various causes, from psychological to social, but he writes in a very easy-to-understand way. Finally, he even suggests some solutions.

I'm working at a university so I really sympathized with his way of thinking. I hope that we will live in a society where honest scientists are valued and where scientists can be honest.
